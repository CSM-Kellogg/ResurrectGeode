### What this is
A replacement for the Geode Scheduler with some add-ons

### NPM and interactJS
I have chosen to use interactJS. This requires installation on my part, but I don't think it's required for anyone else.

### TODO - One bit at a time

ALso in the Issues tab on the Github:

1. Redo the search for courses to use GET and POST requests because ellucian updated and broke the current method of injecting a script and navigating through the website by simulating mouse clicks

2. Figure out the correct payload to send to ellucian to add classes to a students' plan.

3. Figure out if I need some lisencing for using PapaParse and InteractJS.

4. Remove the popup window and separate the functionality to search for courses from the general scheduler page.

5. Look into pinging ellucian for availability on different classes for the current registration period as well as currently registered classes.

6. A way to automatically determine the current registration period
