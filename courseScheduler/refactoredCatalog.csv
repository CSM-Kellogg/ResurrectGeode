Students will study various forms of science communication, including essays, blogs, news segments, media clips, and radio programs in order to understand the ways in which science is communicated beyond the lab or university and into the public consciousness. Science writing often explores the human condition, reflects on hopes and worries about technology, and informs our collective knowledge about the world. Students will discuss the implications of this kind of communication, analyze breakdowns in communication through case studies, and write for peer and popular audiences, including turning a lab report into a short feature article and writing a science essay. 3 hours lecture; 3 semester hours.

Chemical & Biological Engin,528,ADVANCED REACTOR DESIGN,3,CBEN418 or equivalent (instructor may make special exemptions),,"The heart (or, perhaps more appropriately, the stomach) of any chemical manufacturing or refining process is the reactor, where chemical and physical transformations occur under precisely controlled conditions. For traditional industrial chemical processes, the design, optimization and operation of conventional chemical reactors are extremely well developed, drawing upon the principles of chemistry, physics, calculus and economics. However, new-age process concepts proposing to use “exotic” reactors and/or sustainable inputs (e.g., renewable carbon resources, electrons, photons, plasma) face a dearth of well documented reaction engineering principles & design practices that eclipses their rapid adoption. CBEN 428/528 course features a survey of conventional and emerging non-conventional reactors to prepare students for career paths in applied academic or industrial research & development environments. For each reactor type, we introduce the geometry, transport limitations, fluid contacting patterns and options for heat management. Building on these fundamentals, we assess strategies for each reactor’s scale-up, connecting first principles to practical laboratory and reactor simulation approaches to target the information required to deploy the technology. In all cases, we emphasize conceptual reactor design requirements instead of mechanical details. Class time generally features whiteboard lectures and collaborative case studies of real-world reaction engineering examples.

For our purposes, we will focus on any contemporary literature that investigates the plausible and implausible future of technology, science, culture, and society. This course will endeavor to develop student skills in reading, writing, critical thinking, and oral communication by having them deeply read and discuss speculative literature as a genre and will require participation in (and submissions to) our creative writing workshop. Writing and communication skills will be improved through the exploration of selected topics related to the social, cultural, and political ideas that are featured in literature of the future, and we will use the role of the creative literary arts and research in our understanding of the futures we create.
