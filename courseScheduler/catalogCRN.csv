Studies in relevant visual media -films, paintings, and telenovelas - will further our comparative inquiry into the relationships between artistic narrative and critical perspectives on \"the nation.\" Alongside the focal literary and visual texts, the course will address major historians' and social theorists' accounts of the origins, spread, and varied careers of nationalist thought and practice across our modern world. 3 hours seminar; 3 semester hours.

The course is split into three general subject areas; 1) lean manufacturing principles, 2) six-sigma and statistical process control (SPC) methodologies and 3) implementation techniques focusing on graphical and numerical representation of processes using R. Students will receive an in-depth overview of lean manufacturing principles and will perform case studies at local industries to implement learned skill-sets. Next, students will step-through several hands-on activities using real products to investigate six-sigma and perform SPC analysis, identifying shifts in process data and learning how to shift processes into capable processes. Lastly, students will learn about various implementation techniques for industry and will perform an in-depth analysis of the course topics based on the industry tours performed."

Beyond their intrinsic literary values, these texts illuminate distinctive religious, ritual, and popular cultural practices that have shaped collective imaginings of the nation, as well as oscillations in nationalist sentiment across specific regions and historical junctures. Studies in relevant visual media -films, paintings, and telenovelas - will further our comparative inquiry into the relationships between artistic narrative and critical perspectives on \"the nation.\" Alongside the focal literary and visual texts, the course will address major historians' and social theorists' accounts of the origins, spread, and varied careers of nationalist thought and practice across our modern world. 3 hours seminar; 3 semester hours.

These will range from efficient study techniques, memory recall, focus, efficient study and productivity strategies, time management and many others. Research in student success, how people learn, and human behavior indicates that simply teaching a person many ways to study or manage their time does not always result in long term changes. To complement the academic success strategies we teach, Bounce Back also explores many underlying factors related to success both in and out of the classroom.

In practicing this knowledge, students will be able to analyze and design machine elements and structures of homogenous and heterogeneous geometries under axial, torsional, bending, transverse shear, internal pressure loads, and non-uniform loads. Students will be able to quantitatively communicate the outcomes. May not also receive credit for CEEN311. Prerequisite: CEEN241 (C- or better)."

The principles of contaminant transport in surface water, groundwater, and air are also introduced. The course provides students with the conceptual basis and mathematical tools for predicting the behavior of contaminants in the environment. 3 hours lecture; 3 semester hours."

The critical role of organizational knowledge and learning in a firm's ability to leverage technological innovation to gain competitive advantage is explored. The relationships between an innovation, the competencies of the innovating firm, the ease of duplication of the innovation by outsiders, the nature of complementary assets needed to successfully commercialize an innovation and the appropriate strategy for commercializing the innovation are developed. Students explore the role of network effects in commercialization strategies, particularly with respect to standards wars aimed at establishing new dominant designs."

Topics include: 1) laws and security exchange expectations for publicly disclosed documents, 2) feasibility study content, 3) responsibilities of the Qualified Person, 4) capital and operating cost estimation, 5) accruals and taxes, 6) financial analysis and cash flow modeling, 7) sensitivity analysis, and 8) public reporting.  This is exclusively an online course that is cohort based with limited enrollment.  It is offered specifically for the Professional Masters Mining Engineering and Management Program."

Students will analyze the rhetorical strategies behind extreme ideologies, including those found in high-control groups, political propaganda, conspiracy theories, and digital misinformation. Drawing from rhetoric studies, philosophy, social psychology, and media studies, the course will provide students with tools to critically examine persuasive messaging across historical and contemporary contexts. Through a combination of reflective writing, rhetorical analysis, and hands-on research, students will deepen their understanding of the relationship between rhetoric and ideology. Major assessments include an ongoing reading log, a mini-ethnography based on a local cultural event, a document analysis, and a final multimodal project that allows students to apply course concepts in a creative, research-driven format. By the end of the semester, students will be able to critically analyze manipulative rhetoric, apply theoretical frameworks to real-world texts, and enhance their media literacy. They will also develop skills in research, ethical argumentation, and public presentation, culminating in a final project that synthesizes their learning.

What did people eat, wear, or worry about 300 years ago? How did they balance work and leisure, or navigate love, family, and death? Through seminar discussions and hands-on activities, we'll explore a breadth of subjects across place and time that will reframe our understanding of what everyday life meant for the average person, ranging from sports and leisure to public and private life, class and consumption to sights and smells, and trade and production to order and unrest --the same elements of life that shape us today. The course will provide an opportunity for comparative analysis, exploring how societal and individual values influenced daily interactions and beliefs. Many things we take for granted in modern daily life, from family routines to free time, are shaped by those who came before us.

Students will study various forms of science communication, including essays, blogs, news segments, media clips, and radio programs in order to understand the ways in which science is communicated beyond the lab or university and into the public consciousness. Science writing often explores the human condition, reflects on hopes and worries about technology, and informs our collective knowledge about the world. Students will discuss the implications of this kind of communication, analyze breakdowns in communication through case studies, and write for peer and popular audiences, including turning a lab report into a short feature article and writing a science essay. 3 hours lecture; 3 semester hours.

However, new-age process concepts proposing to use “exotic” reactors and/or sustainable inputs (e.g., renewable carbon resources, electrons, photons, plasma) face a dearth of well documented reaction engineering principles & design practices that eclipses their rapid adoption. CBEN 428/528 course features a survey of conventional and emerging non-conventional reactors to prepare students for career paths in applied academic or industrial research & development environments. For each reactor type, we introduce the geometry, transport limitations, fluid contacting patterns and options for heat management. Building on these fundamentals, we assess strategies for each reactor’s scale-up, connecting first principles to practical laboratory and reactor simulation approaches to target the information required to deploy the technology. In all cases, we emphasize conceptual reactor design requirements instead of mechanical details.
