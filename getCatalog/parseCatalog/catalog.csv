They also possess fascinating and complex chemistry that can be quite different from transition metals. The course will start with a history of their discovery and the developments that took place during the Manhattan Project. The course will then continue with fundamentals of f-block chemistry with a focus on electronic structure and thermodynamics. Following this, other core topics will include: 1) environmental chemistry including efforts to remediate Cold War legacy nuclear sites and how chemistry plays a role in this. 2) Aqueous Chemistry. 3) Coordination chemistry. 4) Optical and magnetic properties and the selection rules that determine these phenomena. 5) Catalysis, including small molecule activation and polymerization. 5) Separations and recycling. 6) Nuclear Medicine.

These elements are key components of nearly all electronic devices, and you are currently using about eight of them if you are reading this on a cellphone or computer. They also possess fascinating and complex chemistry that can be quite different from transition metals. The course will start with a history of their discovery and the developments that took place during the Manhattan Project. The course will then continue with fundamentals of f-block chemistry with a focus on electronic structure and thermodynamics. Following this, other core topics will include: 1) environmental chemistry including efforts to remediate Cold War legacy nuclear sites and how chemistry plays a role in this. 2) Aqueous Chemistry. 3) Coordination chemistry. 4) Optical and magnetic properties and the selection rules that determine these phenomena. 5) Catalysis, including small molecule activation and polymerization. 5) Separations and recycling. 6) Nuclear Medicine. Each year the course will be partially tailored to recent discoveries and adjusted in focus based on class interests.","null","Thomas (Thomas) Albrecht","mailto:thomas.albrecht@mines.edu"," Tuesday,Thursday","08/25/2025,12/19/2025","05:00  PM - 06:15  PM"," Coolbaugh Hall , Room 212"

Assessment of the probability of failure or inadequate performance is rapidly gaining ground on the traditional factor of safety approach as a more rational approach to design decision making and risk management. Probabilistic concepts are also closely related to system reliability and Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD). When probability is combined with consequences of failure, this leads to the concept of risk.

How should you assign tasks and resources in a multi-robot team? In this course, we will study planning and (often combinatorial) optimization methods that connect all of these problems.Pre-requisites: Graduate standing; Recommended: CSCI 406 (Algorithms); CSCI 358 (Discrete Mathematics).","null","Micah (Micah) Corah","mailto:micah.corah@mines.edu"," Tuesday,Thursday","08/25/2025,12/19/2025","11:00  AM - 12:15  PM"," Alderson Hall , Room 133"

        This course explores the power of rhetoric in its most intense and consequential forms—how language is used to persuade, manipulate, and control. Students will analyze the rhetorical strategies behind extreme ideologies, including those found in high-control groups, political propaganda, conspiracy theories, and digital misinformation. Drawing from rhetoric studies, philosophy, social psychology, and media studies, the course will provide students with tools to critically examine persuasive messaging across historical and contemporary contexts. Through a combination of reflective writing, rhetorical analysis, and hands-on research, students will deepen their understanding of the relationship between rhetoric and ideology. Major assessments include an ongoing reading log, a mini-ethnography based on a local cultural event, a document analysis, and a final multimodal project that allows students to apply course concepts in a creative, research-driven format. By the end of the semester, students will be able to critically analyze manipulative rhetoric, apply theoretical frameworks to real-world texts, and enhance their media literacy. They will also develop skills in research, ethical argumentation, and public presentation, culminating in a final project that synthesizes their learning. Throughout the course, students will reflect on the ethical implications of rhetoric and its role in shaping belief systems, power structures, and social change.","null","Heather (Heather) Fester","mailto:hfester@mines.edu"," Tuesday,Thursday","08/25/2025,12/19/2025","03:30  PM - 04:45  PM"," Alderson Hall , Room 352"

        This course invites students to explore the intersection of creative nonfiction and place-based writing, using the natural world as both inspiration and subject. Through immersive observation, research, and personal reflection, students will craft essays that engage with the landscapes they inhabit—both real and imagined.
 
Students will read and analyze works by nature writers such as Terry Tempest Williams, Edward Abbey, Robin Wall Kimmerer, and others, examining how storytelling shapes our understanding of the environment. Weekly writing prompts and field exercises will help students develop a keen eye for detail, an ear for lyricism, and a voice that bridges the personal with the ecological.
 
A central focus of the course will be the workshop, where students will share drafts, receive constructive feedback, and refine their essays. Through peer critique and revision, students will develop their ability to craft compelling narratives that explore themes of place, resilience, and the human relationship with nature. By the end of the course, students will have a polished portfolio of creative nonfiction pieces that reflect their engagement with the natural world and their evolving perspective as writers.","null","Heather (Heather) Fester","mailto:hfester@mines.edu"," Tuesday,Thursday","08/25/2025,12/19/2025","02:00  PM - 03:15  PM"," Engineering Annex , Room 115"

        What is the meaning of life? What is human nature? How do various groups of people come together to solve the shared problems of human existence in very different ways? If such questions lead us to explore complex systems of culture, meaning and power, then how can we build the best analytic toolkit to guide our explorations? And how might this topsy-turvy journey through difference and sameness cause us to think more deeply about the meaning of our own lives and our society’s answers to the big questions of the contemporary world?
 
To explore such issues, this course introduces students to the critical, comparative tools of cultural anthropology and equips students to apply these anthropological frameworks to the fundamental questions of human existence today, such as: ethnocentrism, economics, race, class, gender, power, religion, ecological adaptations, etc. Special attention will be given throughout to two major features of the discipline: culture as a foundational concept for social and political analysis, and ethnography as a foundational method and mode of cultural production.","null","Lucas (Lucas) Bessire","mailto:lucas.bessire@mines.edu"," Thursday","08/25/2025,12/19/2025","05:00  PM - 07:50  PM"," Hill Hall , Room 211"

Indeed, the challenges that face the Colorado River's 40 million stakeholders today have less to do with applying law and engineering to developing water resources, and much more to do with figuring out how to share an over-appropriated resource while mitigating the social and ecological consequences of past choices.

        How to Write Big Questions in Science, Engineering &amp; SocietyAs current problems grow beyond the reach of many prior explanations, the big questions of our times merit new forms of communication and reflection. Yet what constitutes a meaningful, transformative, and ethical way to write about the often-troubling complexities of contemporary problems? How can the insights of science, engineering and social science be shared with wider audiences, especially around environmental issues? This course answers those questions through a semester-long exploration that bridges exercises in two kinds of experiential learning: limited fieldwork activities related to student research questions, and the craft of writing in a broadly accessible way. In doing so, this class will equip each student to produce a substantive original piece of writing on a topic that matters. Addressing core questions in interdisciplinary scholarship through hands-on experimentation, this seminar helps students develop their skills as writers, thinkers, collaborators, and field workers, while also gaining new insights into the big questions of our times.","null","Lucas (Lucas) Bessire","mailto:lucas.bessire@mines.edu"," Tuesday","08/25/2025,12/19/2025","05:00  PM - 07:50  PM",""

Students will also be provided with a high-level overview of what risk really means and how to contextualize risk information. Methods of communicating and making decisions based in part upon risk.","null","Mark (Mark) Deinert","mailto:mdeinert@mines.edu"," Tuesday,Thursday","08/25/2025,12/19/2025","11:00  AM - 12:15  PM"," Brown Building , Room W270"

Beyond the ore deposit, water is essential for all mining projects. Supplies must be balanced among local and regional water users. Closure and reclamation is one phase of the mine life cycle and constitutes a significant mitigating action and cost to mining projects. The course will address fundamentals and future trends, but significant emphasis will be placed on the environmental, social, and cost control risks. Topics covered include: 1) water supply, disposal and treatment, 2) site-wide water management, 3) mine waste rock management, 4) process waste and tailings management, 5) solid, hazardous and medical waste minimization, recycling and disposal, 6) closure design (conceptual to construction-ready), 7) surety estimation and available surety instruments, and 8) post-closure elements including monitoring, maintenance, retrenchment, close-out costs and surety release. The importance of effective water and waste management practices, as well as integrating closure planning techniques into engineering designs, will be stressed throughout the project life cycle.

The course covers laboratory safety and current experiment best practices. Instruments common in academia, industry, and national labs are reviewed in their function and properties. Students will review experimental data analysis, error analysis, and error propagation concepts before applying them to experiments. Two weeks are dedicated to a student-facilitator shared experiment focusing on lock-in detection where students will learn the structure of note taking and grading. Students will then use what they learned in the lectures and tutorials to perform three experiments they help design. Although experimental results are expected and required, the course will emphasize scientific note taking and thought process over results. The experiments are intentionally open ended so students will have to think critically about their experimental methods, take detailed notes, and use trial-and-error. Thought process will be operationally defined through tinkering, resilience, teamwork, and communication.","null","Daniel (Daniel) Adams","mailto:daadams@mines.edu"," Monday,Wednesday","08/25/2025,12/19/2025","09:30  AM - 10:45  AM"," Coolbaugh Hall , Room 210"
