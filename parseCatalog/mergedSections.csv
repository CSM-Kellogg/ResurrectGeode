This course introduces the fundamentals of high-frequency measurements, the latest techniques for accuracy-enhanced automated microwave measurements, low-temperature measurement techniques, low noise measurements, and common devices used in quantum information. The course will have three modules. The first module, basics of electronic measurements, will include chip layout, power measurements, ground loop testing, impedance measurements, noise fundamentals, cable and device fabrication and care. The second module, high frequency measurements, will include measurements of basic scattering parameters, accuracy enhancement and calibration, transmission line, amplifier, and oscillator characterization including noise measurements. The third module, low-temperature measurements, will cover critical parameters for superconductors and Josephson junctions, measurements of superconducting resonators, characterization of low-temperature electronic elements including amplifiers.

This course is designed to provide first year graduate students with introductory skills necessary to carry out research in discipline specific laboratories – both in the physics department and post-graduate career settings. The course covers laboratory safety and current experiment best practices. Instruments common in academia, industry, and national labs are reviewed in their function and properties. Students will review experimental data analysis, error analysis, and error propagation concepts before applying them to experiments. Two weeks are dedicated to a student-facilitator shared experiment focusing on lock-in detection where students will learn the structure of note taking and grading. Students will then use what they learned in the lectures and tutorials to perform three experiments they help design. Although experimental results are expected and required, the course will emphasize scientific note taking and thought process over results. The experiments are intentionally open ended so students will have to think critically about their experimental methods, take detailed notes, and use trial-and-error.

Practically, it enables students to solve real-world mechanical behavior problems that involve structural materials. This courses places an early focus on ensuring students have mastered the creation of free body diagrams given a mechanical system, then moves on to introduce and reinforce learning of stress and strain transformations, and failure theories. In practicing this knowledge, students will be able to analyze and design machine elements and structures of homogenous and heterogeneous geometries under axial, torsional, bending, transverse shear, internal pressure loads, and non-uniform loads.

        How to Write Big Questions in Science, Engineering &amp; SocietyAs current problems grow beyond the reach of many prior explanations, the big questions of our times merit new forms of communication and reflection. Yet what constitutes a meaningful, transformative, and ethical way to write about the often-troubling complexities of contemporary problems? How can the insights of science, engineering and social science be shared with wider audiences, especially around environmental issues? This course answers those questions through a semester-long exploration that bridges exercises in two kinds of experiential learning: limited fieldwork activities related to student research questions, and the craft of writing in a broadly accessible way. In doing so, this class will equip each student to produce a substantive original piece of writing on a topic that matters. Addressing core questions in interdisciplinary scholarship through hands-on experimentation, this seminar helps students develop their skills as writers, thinkers, collaborators, and field workers, while also gaining new insights into the big questions of our times.",Main Campus,"['82462', 'Seminar', 'Face to Face', 'C', 'Lucas (Lucas) Bessire', 'mailto:lucas.bessire@mines.edu', ' Tuesday', '08/25/2025,12/19/2025', '05:00  PM - 07:50  PM,PM,PM', '']"

This course will familiarize students with the complexities of contemporary water governance, using the Colorado River system as its central case study. The Colorado River makes for an excellent point of departure because it is one of the most dammed, diverted, legislated, litigated, and loved rivers in the world and because we literally use it up; the river has seldom reached the sea since the 1960s.  Indeed, the challenges that face the Colorado River's 40 million stakeholders today have less to do with applying law and engineering to developing water resources, and much more to do with figuring out how to share an over-appropriated resource while mitigating the social and ecological consequences of past choices.  Our primary goal in the course will be to learn concepts of adaptive governance that provide a constructive and framework for analyzing and addressing such challenges.  3 hours lecture; 3 semester hours.",Main Campus,"['80990', 'Lecture', 'Face to Face', 'A', 'Adrianne (Adrianne) Kroepsch', 'mailto:akroepsch@mines.edu', ' Monday', '08/25/2025,12/19/2025', '03:30  PM - 06:20  PM,PM,PM', ' CoorsTek , Room 150']","['80980', 'Lecture', 'Face to Face', 'A', 'Adrianne (Adrianne) Kroepsch', 'mailto:akroepsch@mines.edu', ' Monday', '08/25/2025,12/19/2025', '03:30  PM - 06:20  PM,PM,PM', ' CoorsTek , Room 150']"

The purpose of this course is to answer these questions by introducing students to bioconversion, nature's ability to convert CO2 into other molecules. In this online, asynchronous course, students will work collaboratively in small teams to discuss current literature on carbon dioxide bioconversion, evaluate the effects of various parameters on bioconversion rates and efficiencies, and design and present case studies on ways to use plants, algae, and bacteria to convert CO2 to useful material.
